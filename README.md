### a) Parametric design, 15'
* Download [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) and create a simple 3D design.
* OpenSCAD is a domain specific [language for CAD](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language).
* Objects can be built by [subtracting](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#difference) simple shapes.
* Design a box that fits a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/raspberry-pi-zero-footprint-dimensions/).
* Export as STL and slice it e.g. in [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura).

Done? Take a look at [this model](https://github.com/sgall17a/Raspi2_case/blob/master/rasppi2.scad).

### b) Second gen products, 15'
* Compare the [Echo Dot](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Amazon+Echo+Dot+Teardown/61304) ([2nd gen](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Amazon+Echo+Dot+2nd+Generation+Teardown/110989)) to the original [Echo](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Amazon+Echo+Teardown/33953).
* What was changed, and what could be the rationale?
* If an injection mold is $10k, how much was saved?
* Which other parts could bring down the price?
